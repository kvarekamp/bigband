GenBank Flat File Release 243.0 
		
	FTP Site:  ftp.ncbi.nih.gov
	Directory: genbank
	URL:       ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/genbank

        Release Date:    April 15, 2021
        Close-Of-Data:   April 26, 2021

The files in this directory comprise GenBank Release 243.0, in the GenBank
flatfile format. Updates to Release 243.0, the WGS, TSA and TLS components
of GenBank, lists of accession number identifiers, and prior release notes
are available in various subdirectories (see below).

GenBank is a member of a tri-partite collaboration of sequence databases
in the U.S., Europe, and Japan, known as the International Nucleotide Sequence
Database Collaboration (INSDC ; http://www.insdc.org ). The collaborating
databases are the European Nucleotide Archive (ENA) at Hinxton Hall, UK
on the Wellcome Trust Genome Campus, and the DNA Database of Japan (DDBJ)
in Mishima, Japan. Patent sequences are incorporated through arrangements
with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, and via the collaborating
international databases from other international patent offices. The database
is converted to various output formats, including the GenBank Flatfile and
Abstract Syntax Notation 1 (ASN.1) versions. The ASN.1 form of the data is
utilized by NCBI's Entrez retrieval system and is also available, as is the
Flatfile version, by anonymous FTP to 'ftp.ncbi.nih.gov'.

For additional information and the GenBank flatfile specification see the
GenBank release notes (gbrel.txt) in this directory.

GenBank releases do not include sequence records that originate from
third-parties (TPA) or from NCBI's Reference Sequence (RefSeq) project.
Rather, GenBank is the archival/primary resource drawn upon by those
other efforts. For information about TPA and RefSeq, please refer to:

	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/tpa/
	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/refseq/about/

GenBank releases also do not contain sequence records that originate
from unfinished Whole Genome Shotgun (WGS) genome sequencing projects.
The sequence-overlap contigs that are assembled from WGS reads are
made available separately, on a per-project basis:

	ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/genbank/wgs

See the section titled 'GenBank WGS Projects', below, for more information.

Similarly, GenBank releases do not include sequences that originate
from Transcriptome Shotgun Assembly (TSA) RNA sequencing projects or from
Targeted Locus Study (TLS) sequencing projects. The sequence data from
those efforts are made available separately, on a per-project basis:

	ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/genbank/tsa
	ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/genbank/tls

See the sections titled 'GenBank Transcriptome Shotgun Assembly Projects'
and 'GenBank Targeted Locus Projects' below, for more information.

Alternative FTP Sites

Mirrors of NCBI's GenBank FTP site are sometimes available from alternate
sites. For example:

        ftp://lucid.bic.nus.edu.sg/biomirrors/genbank/

Some users who experience slow FTP transfers of large files might realize
an improvement in transfer rates from a mirror site when the volume of traffic
at the NCBI is high.

Protein sequences

  The protein sequences present in GenBank releases, via coding regions
annotated on GenBank records, are made available via files located
elsewhere at the NCBI FTP site:

	FTP Site:  ftp.ncbi.nih.gov
	Directory: ncbi-asn1/protein_fasta
	URL:       ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/ncbi-asn1/protein_fasta

  These files replace the single, comprehensive protein FASTA which
used to be provided in this directory ( relNNN.fsa_aa.gz ).

Please see the README in the /protein_fasta directory for further information.

New, changed, and deleted entries

  Entries new, changed, or deleted in Release 243.0 are listed in files
gbnew.txt.gz, gbchg.txt.gz, and gbdel.txt.gz, respectively. Each line of these
files consists of a 3- or 4-character GenBank division abbreviation, followed
by a vertical bar, followed by an accession number.

CON Division

Sequence records in the files of the CON division (gbcon*.seq) are unusual in
that they contain no sequence data at all. Rather, records in these files contain
instructions for the construction of larger-scale objects from 'traditional'
GenBank records.

CON records do not contribute to the statistics for GenBank releases, however
there are record and basepair counts in the header of each gbcon*.seq file.

CON division records are "CONstructed" from others, hence the division's name.
There are two different classes of these records.

The first class of CON records are scaffolds built from the sequence-overlap
contigs of WGS and other sequencing projects. These scaffolds can be as large as
entire chromosomes, depending on the depth of coverage of the WGS project and
the extent of repetitive sequence in the genome.

The second class results from splitting large complete genomes into multiple
pieces (a practice that was used when maximum sequence length limits existed
for GenBank). For example, a bacterial genome might be split into several
hundred records (without interrupting any genes or coding regions), with a small
overlap between each piece. The CON division entries for such genomes provide
instructions for the re-assembly of the complete genome from the individual pieces.
This class of CON division record is nearly obsolete, as previously-split genomes
are actively being identified and converted to back to 'normal' (non-CON) 
representations. 

Entries in the gbcon*.seq files make the relationships among such pieces more
explicit. In addition, CON entries have accession numbers and version numbers,
just like regular GenBank records. 

===============================================================================

Quality Score Data:

	FTP Site:  ftp.ncbi.nih.gov
	Directory: genbank/quality_scores
	URL:       ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/genbank/quality_scores/

Some of the sequence data in GenBank originating from large-scale projects
(eg, the Human Genome Project) is accompanied by quality score information.
These quality scores are generated by base-calling programs such as phred and
phrap, and usually consist of integers ranging from 0 through 100, one
integer per base.

The ASN.1 version of the data used to generate a GenBank flatfile release
incorporates quality score data via Seq-graph annotation objects. This
annotation is then converted to a FASTA-like textual format and presented
in this directory, for those users who do not process ASN.1.

Quality score files have been compressed using gzip, and follow a naming
convention of gb*.qscore.gz .

There is a direct correspondence between the FASTA-like quality score files
in this directory and the ASN.1 data used to build GenBank releases. For example:

	ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/ncbi-asn1/gbhtg1.aso.gz
and:
	ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/genbank/quality_scores/gbhtg1.qscore.gz

are equivalent in content (in terms of the sequences that are represented).

However, since the sequence flatfiles for GenBank release are maintained and
dumped independently of the ASN.1 data, gbhtg1.seq.gz and gbhtg1.qscore.gz
are *NOT* directly related.

GenBank flatfile gbhtg1.seq.gz is likely to contain sequences not present in 
quality score file gbhtg1.qscore.gz, and vice versa.

===============================================================================

GenBank Incremental Updates:

	FTP Site:  ftp.ncbi.nih.gov
	Directory: genbank/daily-nc
	URL:       ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/genbank/daily-nc/

This directory contains individual files for each day's new or updated
sequence entries, processed since the April 26, 2021 close-of-data
date of GenBank Release 243.0, in the GenBank flatfile format.

Two classes of GenBank Incremental Updates (GIUs) exist : one containing
traditional records, and a second containing only CON division records.

The file names used by these two GIU classes are of the form:

	ncMMDD.flat.gz
	con_nc.MMDD.flat.gz

where 'MM' represents a 2-digit value for the month, and 'DD' represents a
two-digit value for the day. For example:

	nc0614.flat.gz
	con_nc.0614.flat.gz

GIU files are compressed using the gzip compression utility, hence the
".gz" filename suffix.

Entries undergoing successive updates on different days will be present in
more than one GIU file. However, a single GIU will not contain multiple
versions of an entry that has undergone several updates within a single day.

NOTE: See the GenBank Release README for further information about CON
division GenBank records:

	ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/genbank/README.genbank

A flatfile GIU is generated by performing a series of ASN.1 dumps from the
databases at NCBI that are used to maintain GenBank, including:

a) All non-HUP (hold-until-publish) entries directly submitted to
   GenBank, or updated at GenBank, during a single day.
b) A single day's new and updated entries received from the EMBL sequence
   database.
c) A single day's new and updated entries received from the DDBJ sequence
   database.
d) All EST sequences added or updated via the NCBI dbEST database on that
   same day.
e) All STS sequences added or updated via the NCBI dbSTS database on that
   same day.
f) All GSS sequences added or updated via the NCBI dbGSS database on that
   same day.
g) All Mammalian Gene Collection sequences added or updated via the
   NCBI MGC database on that same day.

GenBank flatfiles for ASN.1 dumps (a) through (g) are generated, and
are then combined into a single compressed flatfile and installed
in this ftp directory.

A file called "Last.File" in this directory contains the name of the
most recently generated GIU.

GIU processing starts at 1:30am Eastern Time and is usually complete by 3:30am.
The recommended time to look for and transfer new GIU updates from the NCBI
FTP site is 4:30am ET.

GenBank WGS Projects

    FTP Site:  ftp.ncbi.nih.gov
    Directory: genbank/wgs
    URL:       ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/genbank/wgs/

This directory contains data files in a variety of formats for the
sequence-overlap contigs of all Whole Genome Shotgun (WGS) sequencing
projects that have been submitted to the GenBank sequence database.

Data files for each project are grouped by a four-letter or a six-letter
WGS Project Code.

Available WGS data files for each project can include:

    wgs.XXXX.(##.)gbff.gz     Nucleotide GenBank flatfiles
    wgs.XXXX.(##.)fsa_nt.gz   Nucleotide FASTA files
    wgs.XXXX.(##.)qscore.gz   Nucleotide Quality-Score files

    wgs.XXXX.(##.)gnp.gz      Protein GenPept flatfiles
    wgs.XXXX.(##.)fsa_aa.gz   Protein FASTA files

    stats.wgs.XXXX            Summary nucleotide statistics

where 'XXXX' represents a WGS Project Code (for example, AAVP, or AAAABB),
and '(##.)' represents a serial file-number. Because WGS projects can be
large, they are split into a series of numbered files:

    wgs.AAVP.1.gbff.gz
    wgs.AAVP.2.gbff.gz

    wgs.AAVP.1.fsa_nt.gz
    wgs.AAVP.2.fsa_nt.gz

    wgs.AAVP.1.gnp.gz
    wgs.AAVP.2.gnp.gz

    wgs.AAVP.1.fsa_aa.gz
    wgs.AAVP.2.fsa_aa.gz

Quality score and GenPept files will only be available if sequencing scores
have been provided, or if the contigs of a project have been annotated with
coding-region features.

The WGS statistics files provide a summary of each WGS project's status.
Data included are: project code, assembly-version number, total number of
contigs in the project, total number of nucleotide basepairs, and the lengths
of the largest and smallest contigs.
		
All WGS data files have been compressed using the gzip compression utility,
and hence have a ".gz" filename suffix.

Due to the large number of WGS projects, WGS data files are stored within
sub-directories that are based on the initial letters of a given project
code series.

For four-character project codes, the sub-directories consist of the
first character of each project code series. For example:

      AAAA-AZZZ -> Subdir /A
      BAAA-BZZZ -> Subdir /B
      CAAA-CZZZ -> Subdir /C

For six-character project codes, the sub-directories utilize the first
three letters of each project code series. For example:

      AAAAAA-AAAZZZ -> Subdir /AAA
      AABAAA-AABZZZ -> Subdir /AAB
      AACAAA-AACZZZ -> Subdir /AAC
      ....
      BAAAAA-BAAZZZ -> Subdir /BAA
      BABAAA-BABZZZ -> Subdir /BAB
      ....
      CAAAAA-CAAZZZ -> Subdir /CAA
      CABAAA-CABZZZ -> Subdir /CAB
      ....

Each directory can accommodate 17,576 projects. Annotated projects typically
have 6 files, so these directories can contain roughly 106,000 files. This
directory structure is a compromise solution that attempts to keep the directory
tree relatively "flat", but without an unsustainable number of files per
sub-directory. As the number of projects increases, we may have to adopt a
new solution.

WGS processing starts after the non-WGS GenBank Incremental Update has
completed, and WGS files are usually available by 4:30am ET. The recommended
time to look for and transfer new WGS data from the NCBI FTP site is 5:00am ET.
But be aware that the bulk nature of WGS projects can sometimes require more
processing time and delay file availability, particularly when multiple large
projects have to be processed on one day.

terms such as 'assembly-version', please visit:

NOTE: Prior to September 2004, serial numbers were included in WGS filenames
only if the total size of a project exceeded a threshold value. Starting in
September 2004, we adopted a policy of uniformly including the serial number
for every project, regardless of size.

As a result, one can still encounter older, small WGS projects without serial
numbers. For example:

	wgs.AAES.gbff.gz    (old style)
versus
	wgs.AAFV.1.gbff.gz  (new style)

Daily WGS Project-Lists:

Companion WGS Project-Lists that may help facilitate the processing of WGS data
are also provided. These lists were made available starting in October 2005.

Project-Lists utilize a file-naming convention of:

    proj_list.wgs.YYYY.MMDD.HHMMSS
	
where 'YYYY' represents a 4-digit year, 'MMDD' respresents a two-digit
month and two-digit day, and 'HHMMSS' represents two-digit hour, minute
and second. For example:

    proj_list.wgs.2017.1217.022747
    proj_list.wgs.2017.1217.050502

For every day on which new WGS data files are installed in the WGS FTP area,
one or more Project-Lists are provided which briefly describe the
circumstances of the processing which required that installation.

Each line of a Project-List contains three fields, delimited by vertical
bars:

    Project-Action
    WGS Project Code
    Assembly-Version

For example, the Project-List for December 19 2017 was named:

    proj_list.wgs.2017.1219.050502

and the file contained:

    updated|MRZY|01

There are four possible 'Project-Action' values:

    new: used for new WGS projects, being installed in the WGS area for
         the first time

    reassembled: indicates that a WGS project has undergone a re-assembly.

    updated: indicates that new contigs have been added to a WGS project,
         or that one or more of the contigs has been updated in some way;
         however, the assembly-version for the project as a whole is unchanged

    refreshed: indicates that all of the files for a WGS project have been
         rebuilt and re-installed. This action might occur for a relatively
         minor update that affects all the project contigs, such as a
         publication update (in-press -> published). A project might also be
         'refreshed' if it is found to contain contaminant contigs.

One possible use of the WGS Project-Lists is to prioritize processing of
WGS data. Projects that are 'new' or 'reassembled' are almost certain to
be of immediate interest to all users of WGS data. But 'updated' or
'refreshed' projects might require a different approach, particularly if the
project consists of millions of sequences.

Note that the summary statistics file for each WGS project could be of
some help in making prioritization decisions.

Other points of interest:

When data for a WGS project are made available for any of the four
Project-Actions described above, any existing files for that project are
removed prior to the installation of new files.

Only data for the most recent assembly-version of a WGS project is provided
in the WGS FTP area.

Higher-level CON-division records (scaffolds/super-contigs, chromosomes, etc)
that are built from WGS contigs are *not* presented in this WGS FTP area. For
more information about CON division GenBank records, see:

GenBank Transcriptome Shotgun Assembly (TSA) Projects

    FTP Site:  ftp.ncbi.nih.gov
    Directory: genbank/tsa
    URL:       ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/genbank/tsa

This directory contains data files in several formats for sequence-overlap
reads of transcriptomes which have been assembled into transcipts by
computational methods. Additional backgound about the TSA section of GenBank
can be found at:

    http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/tsa

Data files for each TSA project are grouped by a stable 4-letter TSA
Project Code. For example: GACR

Available data files for each TSA project may include:

    tsa.XXXX.##.gbff.gz     RNA GenBank flatfiles
    tsa.XXXX.##.fsa_nt.gz   RNA FASTA files

    tsa.XXXX.##.gnp.gz      Protein GenPept flatfiles
    tsa.XXXX.##.fsa_aa.gz   Protein FASTA files

    tsa.XXXX.mstr.gbff.gz   TSA master-record GenBank flatfile
    stats.tsa.XXXX          Summary TSA statistics

Where 'XXXX' represents a four-letter TSA Project Code, and '##' represents
a serial file-number. Serial file numbers are used in the event that the
data for a very large TSA project has to be split into a series of numbered
files (as of this writing no TSA project is that large, and hence all serial
numbers are '1').

The available data files for the GACR TSA project at the NCBI FTP site as of
March 2013 were:

    stats.tsa.GACR
    tsa.GACR.1.fsa_aa.gz
    tsa.GACR.1.fsa_nt.gz
    tsa.GACR.1.gbff.gz
    tsa.GACR.mstr.gbff.gz

Protein FASTA and GenPept files will only be available if the transcripts of
a TSA project have been annotated with coding region features.

More information about TSA master records is included below.

The TSA statistics files provide a summary of each TSA project's status.
Data included are: project code, assembly-version number, total number of
transcripts in the project, total number of basepairs, and the lengths
of the largest and smallest transcripts.
		
All TSA data files have been compressed using the gzip compression utility,
and hence have a ".gz" filename suffix.

TSA processing starts after the non-WGS GenBank Incremental Update and WGS
processing have completed, and TSA files are usually available by 4:30am ET.
The recommended time to look for and transfer new TSA data from the NCBI FTP
site is 5:00am ET.

But be aware that the bulk nature of TSA and WGS projects can sometimes
require more processing time and delay file availability, particularly when
multiple very large projects have to be provided on one day.

TSA 'master-record' GenBank flatfiles:

TSA projects have an associated TSA master-record which summarizes the
overall content of a project. Here is a link to the master for project GACR
(Ips typographus):

     http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/GACR00000000

And here is an excerpt from that master record:

LOCUS       GACR01000000           14689 rc    mRNA    linear   TSA 05-MAR-2013

//

This flatfile representation of the GACR TSA-master does *not* conform to
the requirements of 'normal' GenBank flatfiles. For example:

- It has neither sequence data nor a CONTIG join() statement.

- The 'rc' (record count) value on the LOCUS line represents the
  number of transcripts in the project, rather than a basepair count.

- Undocumented linetype 'TSA' exists, to provide the range of accession
  numbers for the 14,689 transcripts in the project. 

Nonetheless, a TSA master-record has utility because it provides an
overview of the important characteristics of a TSA project, in a simple
and concise way.

Daily TSA Project-Lists:

Companion TSA Project-Lists that may help facilitate the processing of TSA data
are also provided.

Project-Lists utilize a file-naming convention of:

    tsa.proj_list.YYYY.MMDD
	
where 'YYYY' represents a 4-digit year, and 'MMDD' respresents a two-digit
month and two-digit day. For example:

    tsa.proj_list.2013.0307

For every day on which new TSA data files are installed in the TSA FTP area,
a Project-List is provided that briefly describes the circumstances of the
processing which required that installation.

Each line of a Project-List contains three fields, delimited by vertical
bars:

    Project-Action
    TSA Project Code
    Assembly-Version

For example, the Project-List for March 13 2013 was named:

    proj_list.2013.0313

and this file contained:

    new|GAGF|01
    new|GABX|01

There are four possible 'Project-Action' values:

    new: used for new TSA projects, being installed in the TSA area for
         the first time

    reassembled: indicates that a TSA project has undergone a re-assembly

         or that one or more of the transcripts has been updated in some way;
         however, the assembly-version for the project as a whole is unchanged

    refreshed: indicates that all of the files for a TSA project have been

GenBank Targeted Locus Study (TLS) Projects

    FTP Site:  ftp.ncbi.nih.gov
    Directory: genbank/tls
    URL:       ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/genbank/tls

This directory contains data files in several formats for large-scale
sequencing studies of special marker genes. 

Data files for each TLS project are grouped by a stable 4-letter TLS
Project Code. For example: KAAA

Available data files for each TLS project may include:

    tls.XXXX.##.gbff.gz     DNA GenBank flatfiles
    tls.XXXX.##.fsa_nt.gz   DNA FASTA files

    tls.XXXX.##.gnp.gz      Protein GenPept flatfiles
    tls.XXXX.##.fsa_aa.gz   Protein FASTA files

    tls.XXXX.mstr.gbff.gz   TLS master-record GenBank flatfile
    stats.tls.XXXX          Summary TLS statistics

Where 'XXXX' represents a four-letter TLS Project Code, and '##' represents
a serial file-number. Serial file numbers are used in the event that the
data for a very large TLS project has to be split into multiple numbered
files. As of this writing (November 2016) no TLS project is that large, and
hence all serial numbers are '1'. 

The available data files for the KAAA TLS project at the NCBI FTP site as of
November 2016 were:

    stats.tls.KAAA
    tls.KAAA.1.fsa_nt.gz
    tls.KAAA.1.gbff.gz
    tls.KAAA.mstr.gbff.gz

Protein FASTA and GenPept files will only be available if the sequences of
a TLS project have been annotated with coding region features.

More information about TLS master records is included below.

The TLS statistics files provide a summary of each TLS project's status.
Data included are: project code, assembly-version number, total number of
sequences in the project, total number of basepairs, and the lengths
of the largest and smallest sequences.
		
All TLS data files have been compressed using the gzip compression utility,
and hence have a ".gz" filename suffix.

TLS processing begins after GenBank Incremental Update and after WGS/TSA
processing have completed, and TLS files are usually available by 6:30am ET.
The recommended time to look for and transfer new TLS data from the NCBI FTP
site is 7:00am ET.

But be aware that the bulk nature of WGS/TSA/TLS projects can sometimes
require more processing time and delay file availability, particularly when
multiple very large projects have to be provided on one day.

TLS 'master-record' GenBank flatfiles:

TLS projects have an associated TLS master-record which summarizes the
overall content of a project. Here is a link to the master for project KAAA

     https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/KAAA00000000

And here is an excerpt from that master record:

LOCUS       KAAA01000000          169849 rc    DNA     linear   ENV 07-APR-2016
DEFINITION  TLS: uncultured bacterium 16S ribosomal RNA, targeted locus study.

This flatfile representation of the KAAA TLS-master does *not* conform to
the requirements of 'normal' GenBank flatfiles. For example:

- It has neither sequence data nor a CONTIG join() statement.

- The 'rc' (record count) value on the LOCUS line represents the
  number of sequences in the project, rather than a basepair count.

- Undocumented linetype 'TLS' exists, to provide the range of accession
  numbers for the 169,849 sequences in the project. 

Nonetheless, a TLS master-record has utility because it provides a
simple and concise overview of the important characteristics of a
TLS project.

Daily TLS Project-Lists:

Companion TLS Project-Lists that may help facilitate the processing of TLS data
are also provided.

Project-Lists utilize a file-naming convention of:

    tls.proj_list.YYYY.MMDD.HHMMSS
	
where 'YYYY' represents a 4-digit year, 'MMDD' respresents a two-digit
month and two-digit day, and HHMMSS represents a two-digit hour, a two-digit
minute, and a two-digit second. For example:

    tls.proj_list.2016.1111.050502

For every day on which new TLS data files are installed in the TLS FTP area,
a Project-List is provided that briefly describes the circumstances of the
processing which required that installation.

Each line of a Project-List contains three fields, delimited by vertical
bars:

    Project-Action
    TLS Project Code
    Assembly-Version

For example, the Project-List for November 11 2016 (mentioned above) contains:

    new|KACE|01
    new|KAIK|01
    new|KABS|01
    ....
    ....
    new|KAEA|01
    new|KABR|01
    new|KABC|01

There are four possible 'Project-Action' values:

    new: used for new TLS projects, being installed in the TLS area for
         the first time

    reassembled: indicates that a TLS project has undergone a re-assembly

    updated: indicates that new sequences have been added to a TLS project,
         or that one or more of the sequences has been updated in some way;
         however, the assembly-version for the project as a whole is unchanged

    refreshed: indicates that all of the files for a TLS project have been
         rebuilt and re-installed. This action might occur for a relatively
         minor update that affects all the project contigs, such as a
         publication update (in-press -> published). A project might also be
         'refreshed' if it is found to contain contaminant transcripts.

One possible use of the TLS Project-Lists is to prioritize processing of
TLS data. Projects that are 'new' or 'reassembled' are almost certain to
be of immediate interest to all users of TLS data. But 'updated' or
'refreshed' projects might require a different approach, particularly if the
project consists of millions of sequences.

Note that the summary statistics file for each TLS project could be of
some help in making prioritization decisions.

Other points of interest:

When data for a TLS project are made available for any of the four
Project-Actions described above, any existing files for that project are
removed prior to the installation of new files.

Only data for the most recent assembly-version of a TLS project is provided
in the TLS FTP area.

GenBank Livelists:

	FTP Site:  ftp.ncbi.nih.gov
	Directory: genbank/livelists
	URL:       ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/genbank/livelists/

This directory contains lists, generated weekly on Sunday evening at
approximately 6:00pm EST/EDT, of all nucleotide and protein accession
numbers for the sequences in GenBank. File names for these lists are
of the form:

	GbAccList.MMDD.YYYY.gz

where MM represents a 2-digit value for the month, DD represents a 2-digit
value for the day, and YYYY represents a four-digit value for the year.
These files have been compressed with the gzip compression utility, hence
the ".gz" suffix.

Each line of these lists contains three comma-delimited values: accession
number, sequence version number, and NCBI GI identifier. Protein accessions
can be easily distinguished from nucleotide accessions because they have a
three-letter prefix, followed by five digits. The remaining accessions are
nucleotide accessions, in either a one-letter/five-digit format or a
two-letter/six-digit format.

Here's an example from the accession list for AF093062 and its protein
translation AAC64372 :

	AF093062,2,6019463
	AAC64372,2,6019464

In the GenBank flatfile representation of AF093062, the accession and
sequence version can be found on the VERSION line and in the /protein_id
qualifiers of the coding region feature:

LOCUS       AF093062     2795 bp    DNA             INV       12-OCT-1999
DEFINITION  Leishmania major polyadenylate-binding protein 1 (PAB1) gene,
            complete cds.
ACCESSION   AF093062
VERSION     AF093062.2

                     /protein_id="AAC64372.2"
                     /translation="MAAAVQEAAAPVAHQPQMDKPIEIASIYVGDLDATINEPQ....

In the ASN.1 representation of AF093062, these fields can be found within
the Bioseq.id chain of the nucleotide and protein bioseqs:

    seq {
      id {
        genbank {
          name "AF093062" ,
          accession "AF093062" ,
          version 2 } ,
	....
    seq {
